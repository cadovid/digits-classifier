# Handwritten digits classifier

For this project, we'll deploy the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm along with different architectures of a multilayer percentron (MLP) feedforward neural network to compare the scores in an imagen classification problem. For this we'll use a preloaded dataset from the package `sklearn` which contains handwritten digits data.
